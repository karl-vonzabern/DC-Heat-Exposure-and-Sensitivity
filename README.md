# DC Heat Exposure and Sensitivity

We hope this app allows users to explore the data and answer important empirical questions about the social and economic correlates that exacerbate extreme heat in DC. Our app will users better understand the answer to two specific questions:

What are environmental metrics that are correlated with Urban Heat Island Effects?

What environmental characteristics of certain census tracts create larger heat exposure sensitivity indexes? Understanding the environmental factors would help in identifying policy approaches that would mitigate the probability of heat-induced health events.

What are recurring sociodemographic trends that are associated with higher heat exposure sensitivity indexes?

Who are the communities that are at a larger risk of heat-induced health events? Identifying socio-demographic trends can assist policymakers in identifying the communities that would best benefit from policy implementation.

The user for this app will most likely be someone within the DC government’s Department of Energy and Environment or Health and Human Services. The purpose of the visual representation and statistical modeling would be to assist in the formulation of policy that attempts to mitigate the occurrences of heat-related health incidences.


Data Source and Structure:
HSEI Data

Heat Sensitivity Exposure Data was gathered from Open Data DC and contains variables related to socioeconomic, health, and environmental metrics for DC’s 206 census tracts.
DC Cooling Center Data

When the temperature or heat index in the District reaches 95 degrees, District Government, through the Department of Human Services (DHS) and the Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency (HSEMA), will implement the Heat Emergency Plan and activate cooling centers for residents to seek relief. We provide locations, name of center, phone number and hours of cooling centers. Data comes from Open Data DC
DC Tree Data

DDOT’s Urban Forestry Division (UFD) is the primary steward of Washington DC’s ~170,000 public trees and has a mission of keeping this resource healthy, safe, & growing! Trees provide many benefits to the populations such as improving air and water quality and creates habitat for local fauna. Importantly trees are also critical for keeping the city cooler.
